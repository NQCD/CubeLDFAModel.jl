# CubeLDFAModel

The functionality of this package has been reimplemented in [FrictionProvidersLDFA.jl](https://github.com/NQCD/FrictionProvidersLDFA.jl). The new package further provides LDFA from different density sources, including scikitlearn models. This package should be regarded as deprecated and usage of FrictionProvidersLDFA.jl is preferred.
